# facial_similarity
 Compare faces and calculate and obtain larget similarity in the data base.
 
 This project uses pretrained caffe model for facial detection (source: https://github.com/vinuvish/Face-detection-with-OpenCV-and-deep-learning)
 
 VGGfaces is used to obatin the facial characteristics, and used euclidean distance to obtain the differences. (source: https://github.com/rcmalli/keras-vggface)
